# Welcome to my portfolio project!

Although certainly not necessary, I've developed my site with React as an oppurtunity to get more comfortable with it. I made my very first portfolio in 2022, when I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do. This site was a display of my graphic design projects (which can still be viewed on my new and improved site!). However, I've since realized I wanted to fully pursue software development--hence the complete site rebuild. I designed the site myself in Figma, and am implementing it with React and Next.js.
